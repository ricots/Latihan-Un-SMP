		Dear Tantri,
		<p>
		Nowadays, it's difficult to find a true friend like you. I sometimes think I am 
		very lucky to get you as my friend. Without you, my life would have been very 
		boring. I still remember the first day of school when we were young. You called
		 me and gave me a seat. That moment is not easy to forget. It is the beginning of 
		our long friendship. You even often shared some of your food when my mother 
		forgot to give me pocket money. You also lent me a dictionary when I forgot to 
		bring it. It's almost 15 years we have been shared problems and fun together. 
		Now, you're not here anymore. I would like to thank you for being there for me 
		for the ups and downs of my life.
		<p>
		It's time for us to be apart. You have to move to Surabaya. I just want to say that 
		you are my best friend. It is difficult for me to say goodbye. I don't want you to 
		leave me but I know that moving to Surabaya is very important for your future. 
		I only hope that you will get everything that you dream of in your new city. One 
		thing that I want to tell you, please don't forget me. Keep in touch. Send me an 
		email and tell your activities there. Don't make the distance break our 
		relationship.
		<p>
		It is hard for me to stay away from you. I can't wait to meet you soon.
		<p>
		  <br/>
		With best wishes,
		<br/>
		Truly yours,
		<p>
		  <br/>
		Veny

  <div id="engkungs">
	<p>
	Someone that I admire most is my mother. She is my idol. In my opinion, my 
	mother is not only beautiful but also kind. In addition, she is a good housewife.
	<p>
	  Her beauty comes from her good looking physical appearance. She is average in 
	height. Her straight, black hair is shiny. Furthermore, the color of her eyes is like 
	honey. And her light brown skin is still very supple. She looks attractive in whatever 
	clothes she wears.
	<p>
	  Besides her attractive appearance, my mother is very kind. She likes to help 
	people. For example, whenever there are sick people in our neighborhood, she will 
	give them a visit. She often gives food and drink to the unfortunate people. She pays 
	the school fee of some orphans in the surroundings. And something that impresses me
	more is she doesn't like other people to know whenever she does good deed. 
	<p>
	  In addition, my mother is a good housewife. She takes care of her family well. For 
	instance, she prepares all the healthy food for the whole family. She keeps the house 
	clean and organized. She makes sure that the whole family's need is fulfilled. She is a 
	great mother and I love her very much.

		  Once, there lived a hen called Red Feather because the color of her feather 
		was red. One day, the fox caught the red feather and put it into a sack. He intended 
		to bring the hen home and cooked it for dinner. 
		<p>
		  Suddenly, he saw a dove lying on the ground. The fox was delighted to find a 
		dove, he thought of having a lot of food for dinner. He didn't know that the dove 
		was a friend of the red feather. The dove knew that the fox had caught the Red 
		Feather. He wanted to help the red feather by pretending to have a broken wing and 
		lying on the ground for the fox to catch.
		<p>
		  The fox left the hen in the sack trying to catch the dove. As the fox got closer, 
		the dove instantly flew away leaving the fox. Meanwhile the fox was busy trying to 
		catch the dove; the hen released herself from the sack and ran away as fast as 
		possible. The fox wasn't able to catch the dove so he decided to stop chasing. But 
		when the fox came back to his sack, how shocked he was to find the Red feather 
		had already gone. Finally the fox realized that he had nothing for dinner. (Taken
